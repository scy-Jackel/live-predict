In the lung cancer patient survival prediction and treatment plan recommendation algorithm, two research methods are used to improve the model effect: 3D convolutional neural network is used to extract high-level features of lung cancer patient data and add spatial attention mechanism to improve the performance of model prediction. Convolutional neural network has a strong ability to extract spatial features. Among them, 3D CNN expands the controllable range of convolution kernel to the time domain. Compared with 2D convolution, it is more flexible and can learn more spatial information. Spatial area attention can be understood as telling the neural network where to look. Through the attention mechanism, the spatial information in the original image is transformed into another space and the key information is retained, which increases the receptive field.
